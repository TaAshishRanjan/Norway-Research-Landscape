This study takes a deep dive into the key research themes in Norway and how they
have evolved over time. Leveraging Social Network Analysis (SNA) methods, we
explored the relevance and intersections of different research topics. The data for
our study was sourced from projects funded by the Research Council of Norway
between 2012 and 2023. We used Python and Gephi for data analysis. By
constructing a co-occurrence matrix and using centrality analysis, we were able to
extract and analyze research keywords. The parameters for our centrality analysis
included degree centrality, betweenness, and edge weight.
Our analysis revealed that research topics related to sustainability, mental health,
climate change, technology, the digital world, Arctic climate, and energy were
prominently featured in the Norwegian context. Interestingly, our findings suggest
that highly technical scientific themes such as engineering, accelerator
technologies, microchips, DNA studies, and sensor technologies received
comparatively less attention. However, we noted a recent surge in popularity for
research related to Artificial Intelligence. This study provides a detailed overview
of the evolution, connectivity, and relative importance of various research topics in
Norway over a significant period.
